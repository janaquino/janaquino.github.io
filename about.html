  Hi! My name is Jan-alfred, though most people will usually call me Jan or Alfred.
  I was born in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. at the age of five, and have 
  lived in New Jersey ever since! Right now I'm finishing up my Bachelor's degree
  in Molecular Biology at Yale, graduating in May 2017. 
  I built this site as a way to showcase my  professional and personal interests. 
  I hope to eventually push up a blog and a photography portfolio, as well as any
  academic projects that I've worked on, but for now I have only left up an electronic
  version of my resume. This site is a work in progress, and I'll be sure to update it 
  with new content ever so frequently!<br><br>
  
  Anyway, I guess that's not really ~about me~. I always struggle to write things as
  existential as online biographies, since I'm more used to writing reports or things
  that are more narrowly focused. But I'll give it a shot: I like dogs, food, and 
  Snapchat, among other things. I'd rather spend a day at a museum than on a beach.
  I like playing with data but I'm more interested in using data to tell a story. I
  think opportunity and ambition are more important than intelligence. My favorite 
  drink is a Tom Collins. <br><br>
  
  Thanks for reading but I think there's so much more to learn from someone than from
  just an online biography. Please feel free to contact me for a conversation!
