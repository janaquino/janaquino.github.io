  Hi! My name is Jan-alfred, though most people will usually call me Jan or Alfred.
  I was born in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. at the age of five, and have 
  lived in New Jersey ever since. Right now I'm finishing up my Bachelor's degree
  in Molecular Biology at Yale, graduating in May 2017. 
  I built this site as a way to showcase my  professional and personal interests. 
  I hope to eventually push up a blog and a photography portfolio, as well as any
  academic projects that I've worked on, but for now I have only left up an electronic
  version of my resume. This site is a work in progress, and I'll be sure to update it 
  with new content ever so frequently!<br><br>
  
  Anyway, I guess that's not really ~about me~. I always struggle to write things introspectively,
  since I'm more used to writing reports or things
  that are more narrowly focused. So I'll write a list of things about me which may
  or may not have anything to do with each other: 
  <ul>
    <li>I like dogs, food, and Snapchat, among other things.</li>
    <li>I'd rather spend a day at a museum than on a beach.</li>
    <li>I'm probably a Slytherin.</li>
    <li>My favorite drink is a Tom Collins.</li>
    <li>In my spare time I like to play League of Legends or take a nap.</li>
    <li>I like to dress nicely but my choice of outfit is limited by my motivation to do laundry.</li>
    <li>My professional interests include biotechnology, entrepreneurship, and data.</li>
  </ul> 
 
  Thanks for reading but I think there's so much more to learn from someone than from
  just an online biography. Please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:janalfred.aquino@gmail.com?Subject=Hello" target="_top">janalfred.aquino@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions or would like to chat!
