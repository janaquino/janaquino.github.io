          In November 2016, I signed an offer to join Beghou Consulting in New York as an Associate Consultant,
          starting in July 2017. Beghou Consulting employs data-driven sales and marketing analytics to the life sciences
          and pharmaceutical industries. I'm excited to utilize my skillset, to learn more about the highly dynamic
          healthcare industries, and to be in such a vibrant city after graduation for my first full-time job!</div>

          I joined the Investment Banking Team at InvestmentBank.com in January 2017 for two reasons: 1) to find out why so many of 
          my peers go into banking as their first job after graduation and 2) to learn more about how the financial world works.
          So far, I've really liked the work I've been doing. Right now, I'm working on a sell-side M&A deal in the biotechnology
          industry and it's really interesting to see how finance and science interact in a transaction.</div>

            <li>Analyze results of quantitative PCR and tissue cultures using statistical methods</li>
          </ul>
          I worked in Prof. Dimitrova's lab for a year as part of my senior undergraduate thesis, studying the effect of downregulating
          p53-regulated long non-coding RNAs, an understudied segment of molecular biology. As the capstone of my studies in the major,
          I gained valuable research and experimental skills, but more importantly, I learned the importance of doing "good science" and 
          the impact that basic research could have in our everyday lives.</div>

          In the summer of 2016, I interned for SeamlessDocs in New York, a technology start-up introducing local governments
          to the technologies of the 21st Century. I enjoyed the dynamic culture and high energy of the company, and really sank my teeth
          into all the challenges facing a fast-growing start-up. The result was an incredible experience and tangible
          results to show for my effort.</div>

          During the school year, I work as a part-time intern at NewsRx, a publishing company 
          that delivers high-quality information and knowledge to industries ranging from biotechnology
          and pharmaceuticals to financial services. NewsRx employs an artificial intelligence software
          to deliver only that information that users want to see and none of the other stuff. Right now,
          I'm conducting research and writing a series of articles involving artificial intelligence and how it affects our
          daily lives, as well as how it can change them in the near future.</div>

          In December of 2016, I turned over my co-presidency of Kasama (Tagalog for "together") after two full years
          running the organization. My involvement with Kasama was one of the most defining experiences of my undergraduate
          years, and through it I developed a clear understanding of the importance of strong leadership. I learned that while the physical and logistical things (like buying groceries or
          rehearsing dances until 2 AM for a cultural show) were important to the strength of the organization, what's more important is
          the ability to motivate a team (albeit a small one) to do not-so-small things.</div>
